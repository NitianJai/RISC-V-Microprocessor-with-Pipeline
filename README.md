# RISC-V-Microprocessor-with-Pipeline
This project introduces pipelining, a key concept in modern CPU design that enhances performance by overlapping instruction execution. It covers the common pipeline stages—Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory Access, and Write-Back—explaining their roles in instruction processing. And step-by-step breakdown of how instructions flow through the pipeline.
